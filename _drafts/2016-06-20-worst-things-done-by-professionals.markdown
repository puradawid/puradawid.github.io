Good picture.

A short introduction that seniors ain't saints. They have some troubles with working too.
Hard to tell why it is happening but some people even they are doing their job well have
some issues. Here they are:

## Upskilling problems

This is something that most of developers are aware of. It is quite obvious that learning
is every developer's curse and there is no option to let it as it is and stop improving yourself.
However I can see sometimes falls that should not be acceptable:

### Learning Stuff During Worktime
> Hey, I want to read book X today to make myself better programmer, do you mind?

Did you hear that anybody say something similar in last 2 months? I don't think so. Mostly people
are getting such stuff hidden, performance is getting a little lower (it takes time eventually).
Therefore when it comes out:

> Why you didn't ask in the first place?

Do not get me wrong - I am a fan of learning on demand. It seems to be more agile than
being well-informed at the first place. I am saying about learning things during work hours 
that are 

### Relying on employer

Investing in a employee skills seems to be a good idea at first glance, right?

It turns out it is not. 

# Draft Notes

Draft so don't mind being a graphist here:
- [decision making] upskilling
  - relies on employer (asking for ridiculously trainings instead of buying a book and reading it)
  - learning stuff during worktime
  - not investing into tools (IDE learning features, shortcuts whatever, version control)
- [decision making] programming by coincidence (made by someone from some book I don't remember)
- [decision making] blocking things without any workarounds (I have to ask X because I need him so I will wait...)
- [decision making] looking on details like formatting instead of really serious problems (and getting those into discuss)
- [decision making] asking stakeholders which implementation way take (essentially not technical people to handle that)
  - especially when decision is already made by a professional but he wants to make person responsible
- [decision making] not being pragmatic (what does it mean?)
  - not following team's priorities
  - metaprogramming (getting to abstract code than neccessary)
  - implementing features that are not requested but its nice to have (like trimming a string).
- [decision making] making decisions based on politics
- [communication] calling instead of writing (hey I cannot explain it on paper, can I call you now?)
- [communication] getting angry on feedback (testers, peers)
