Agencies. They are everywhere. If you have a [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com)
account you know exactly what I am talking about. Every time I open incoming
box [Monty Python's sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anwy2MPT5RE) is
happening in front of my eyes. I get plenty offers daily. Usually they are
about working for companies that are looking for specific client and project,
[lol](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/LOL#English).

The existence of agencies is not bad at all. In fact they might be really good
places to work, allowing specialist to do what he or she love to and securing
job position even for a years with many end-customers. In that case margin
agency earns is completely fair for both sides (worker and agency). 

What's the bad agency then? How is it happening that people are unhappy
with the job they have got? I can generalise few things that I experienced
already. I hope that after reading this small blog post you would be able
to recognise patterns and just reject bad offers. Most of senior developers
are already familiar with these, although this might save years of shame for
younger or junior programmers. Wish you nice reading! :)

# Case #1: One client, one project, one you

> I am looking for a programmer to join X project in Y company!

Looks fine isn't it? Usually recruiter from different company is looking for a
candidate and finally you will sign a contract with Y company. Although: 

> I am looking for programmer to join project in company that is a leader of Z industry

The first thing is, it is not a recruitment for specific company represented by
recruiter. When I was joining [Sii](https://sii.pl/en/) I applied for this
company and the potential client was irrelevant at this stage. When someone is
saying that you will work for ABC although you will have a contract signed with
XYZ this smells a lot. From the early beginning everyone is telling that you
will work for specific company.

This has one major consequence: agency wants to cover missing position they
cannot internally. That is simply earning profit for your work. Most probably
when you quit client there would not be another one. Transparency of hiring,
huh?

Shortly: refuse signing contract with company A while you were only interviewed
with company/client B.  

Here is a second thing though: hiding an actual chain of companies. You should
not be interested in our company, because it is not doing anything apart from
re-billing company you will work for. This is a [SUPER
MEH](https://media.giphy.com/media/ELE38BM27p1JK/giphy.gif).  If the only
advantage of agency is acquiring customer then it will be a valuable asset
which has to be hidden from everyone else. The rest of effort equals zero.

What is the point to give their own money then?

# Case #2: Many companies in the middle that do nothing

> Just keep in mind: while speaking with D's representative just say you are
> from C company.  > It's top secret that you are hired through A through B to
> C.

That is actually my favourite one, although it is quite unusual.

So imagine that company C is looking for a specialist. They are asking their
resources provider B to get someone on board ASAP. There is no guy in B
that will fulfill needs of C so they are asking A company to deliver someone.
Yet they will earn own margin so they are looking for relatively cheap agency.

That is absolutely fine when A has actual spare specialist to outsource.

It is very bad when they are starting to look for someone ASAP. They will just
optimise short-term economic: hire the cheapest as possible.

Poor C are they aware of that model? Not at all!

For sake of your own credibility: do not join this kind of gig. Kindly refuse
telling bullshit to anyone. At the end of the day you would be the bad person
there. 

# Case #3: Promise of a raise in few months

> I know we said X and there is X - Y written in a contract, but we will give
> you raise in a few months.

No, they won't. Usually it depends on a bill  

# Case #4: Raise after resign
