This is the very beginning of the book I would like to write some day.

The aim here is to write all my thoughts and values, how I see the world and how it affects me as a human being.

I would include couple of chapters:
- What is life and how I see its purpose?
- Is there God among us? What drives the good deeds?
- What is a family to me.
- Couple of words about love, friends and allies.
- Do animal play significant role in my life? How I see them.
- Society in general
- Let's play Civilization

I guess this book should be written within LaTeX system, just to keep that editable over the years, as it should not be finished till I die. Death will give me a clousre for working on this book.
