There is a main rule in all remote working companies - they have to be prepared for such enormous and exhausting effort which is reducing cost and hiring the best of the bests around the globe. It isn't an easy task at all. Still many companies simply don't know how to effectively manage people that are working from home and how to measure this effectiveness.

# Problem: people are too lazy to work at home

Most of the thoughts I am a direct victim are rather simple - programmer cannot work at home. Why? Because they are lazy bitches with desire of having money and spending it on some fucking lava lamps or games. I don't have to explain how much I disagree. Firstly because of really good developers are working for fun and money is a side effect, however important but not that much.

I am choosing my clients regarding to salary of course, but I have never picked up some other job than software development even if I would have so much money that I don't have to pick anything at all. Its exactly the same what I am doing now so please don't tell me that I don't care about software development. I am sure that majority of developers that I had pleasure to work with share those same thoughts.

Well, anyone could probably find an example that proves humans are not able to work at home. I am pretty sure that will contain an environmental cause like crying child, cat or dog, or attractive distractions like video games or doing whatever he/she can besides of working. Yes, there might be a lot of those people but still it should sound reasonable that there a lot of *professionalists* that are really working within their remote environments and do it damn good. No distractions, no kids, working at even better than office's environment.

Being a part of working remotely people I want to share some common good practices that allows companies to hire more and more remote developers with having also own on site. The reason I am writing this because I saw already companies that are not ready to do this in a short period on time, especially when getting more than couple of them at once. I will explain those problems with minimal amount of words (I guess).

Still, if you will decide to hire someone that will work far away from your office, then where you should start? THE ONBOARDING of course! You have some options, regarding to your company possibilities, budgets and security policies.

# Onboarding with temporary on site placement

That’s interesting and common practice which allows employers ask remote candidates to come directly into facility that will lead or be main participant in project. During this time developer should gain all accesses to internal tools and systems, learn how to report work time or other procedures that cannot be easily explained through remote communication. Anyway if you have that complex practices probably someone have to work on it to simplify. Usually it should take two days maximum. If you cannot deliver in shorter time better review the content of such process. Otherwise, you are loosing too much money and developer’s time.

I am sure that any company can make it in such short time (think about deferring trainings and move more to some e-learning platform). Remember, onboarding people would not happen once. It is an ongoing process that might happen many times - especially when you or your department is growing.

The second thing that developer should know is the team. Meeting live organisms makes remote communication more effective and direct. Set up some unofficial meeting after hours (not necessarily with alcohol) to get know each other, it is really possible that people would appreciate such event. Otherwise, you are an asshole as a manager, or even worse :).

You should focus on communication channel that will replace usual chatting at the office. Skype's conversation or even some voice chat might be very useful here. It should not be official, or even project related. Make a place where people can talk about anything. Don’t worry, they would not spend all day chatting, and even they will, you receive an information that you hired wrong people. Anyway, you have to create also chats regarding to project or technology that is used. Remember, you have to trace chats to be up-to-date what developers are complaining on or what problems they are having. Still, you don't have to be an asshole and complain about their language or other shit they will say there. Remember - it's just a chat place, don't expect too much.

# Onboarding 100% remotely

Oh, so you hired abroad developers? That might be problematic regarding to having no time to get them onsite even for a day. Don’t plan them a call that will take ages. Create a one entry-point document where step-by-step they can get all accesses and knowledge how to work for you, what are the standards and so on. It might look expensive, however it won’t require your current workers to make a long meetings. It seems to be trivial, but during the development the worst thing you can do for the project is taking people out for no reason. You can assess that newcomers read all documents - by testing or something similar.
