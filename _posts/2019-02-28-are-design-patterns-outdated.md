> How many design patterns do you know?

> How do you implement **Observer**?

> What Java class has been implemented with **Decorator** pattern?

Every interview was starting with these questions. How many design patterns I **don't** know? I read the book, I knew every single coming from Group of Four. Heck, I had these patterns taught in the University!

Are they used now, anyway?

Well, my personal perspective says: not really. There are not many patterns here, these questions are not even asked anymore. That's might be right or wrong - we know that many [cognitive biases][cog] are influencing our judgement.

Let's do the Google Trends then:

It looks like the trend is going down over time. Is it sad? Are we just done with "reusable" code? I am looking forward to read your opinion.

But are we really not using design patterns? Let's do the poll:

I really appreciate to submit your answers! I hope we will make around 100 responses and I will summarise results in the next post!

Stay tuned!
