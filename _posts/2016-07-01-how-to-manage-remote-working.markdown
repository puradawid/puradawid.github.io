There is a main rule in all remote working companies - they have to be prepared for such enormous
and exhausting effort which is reducing cost and hiring the best of the bests around the globe.
It isn't an easy task at all. Still many companies simply don't know how to effectively manage
people that are working from home and how to measure this effectiveness.

Problem: people are too lazy to work at home
--------------------------------------

Most of the thoughts I am a victim are rather simple - programmer won't work at home. Why? Because
they are lazy bitches with desire of having money and spending it on some fucking lava lamps or
games. I don't have to explain how much I disagree. Firstly because of good developers that are
working for fun and money is a side effect, however important but not that. Why? I am choosing my
clients regarding to salary of course. But I have never pick up some other job even if I would have
so much money that I don't have to. Its exactly the same what I am doing now so please don't tell me
that I don't care about software development, please. I am sure that majority of developers that I had
pleasure to work with have those same thoughts.

Well, anyone could probably find an example that proves humans are not able to work at home. I am
pretty sure that example will contain an environment cause like crying child, cat or dog, OR
attractive distractions like video games or doing whatever he/she can besides of working. Yes, there
might be a lot of those people but still it should sound reasonable that there a lot of
**professionalists** that are really working on their's remote environments and do this damn good.
No distractions, no kids, working at even better than office's environments.
