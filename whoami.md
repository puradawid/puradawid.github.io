## Hi there,

I am glad you are here. This place has to be comfortable for both of us. I am
going to define my goal, describe you and answer how we both can benefit from
our symbiosis.

Enjoy!

### What is the reason for writing this?

I used to ask people what their life's goals are, so I am forced to write down
mine as well. It is all about doing work that impacts on million people. I am
dead serious here. Programming was the best skill I have ever had so far.
Currently, I am participating in the development of the most popular products on
the Earth.

Writing a blog is about recording thoughts, facts and context. It makes my
progress more visible for you and myself. You can see my weaknesses and
strengths. Visibility makes me better. Eventually, I will get closer to the
goal. Am I right or wrong?

I need you. Your opinions about my progress matter to me. I wouldn't follow the
majority voice though. Various perspectives helped me solve problems before,
but they aren't simple recipes for success.

### Who is my audience?

Generally, this blog is for software engineers - regardless of the level of
professionalism or seniority (which is not the same thing IMO). Preferably, you
can write some code (and read it afterwards!). Ideally, you are more
intelligent and experienced than I am (which is not difficult) and keen on
giving me a lot of feedback.

Project managers, Scrum masters and QA people also welcomed here! There is no
software without your input, ideas and hard work.

### Why should you follow it?

We, software engineers, love patterns. We are using them all the time. I am
going to find the one of being successful in software engineering. Sharing my
experience may prevent you from making mistakes I have done already.

Your advice, directions and thoughts will help me. You can have a real impact
on my life. Let's make it an exciting journey!
