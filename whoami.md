## Hi there,

I am glad you visit my blog. In order to make this place good for both of us
I had to define my goal, who are you and how we both can benefit from here.

Enjoy the reading! 

### Why am I writing this blog?

My life goal is do work that has an impact on million people. I bet
on my programming skills years ago - now participating in development of the
most popular products on the Earth.

By writing this blog, I am making this progress more visible for you and
myself. You can see my weaknesses and strengths. Visibility of these will make
me better, eventually - I will be closer to the goal. Is it a good thesis?
Let's try to make an experiment!

I need you. Your opinions about my progress are important. It isn't like I
would blindly follow the voice of majority though - I have learnt that
different perspectives help me solve problems but they are never simple
recipes for success.

### Who is my audience?

This blog is mostly for software engineers - regardless level of professionalism
or seniority (which is not the same thing IMO). Preferably, you need to know
what is a programming and can write some code (and read it afterwards!). Ideally,
you are more intelligent than I am (which is not difficult) and keen on giving
me a feedback.

There is no programming without a team and organisational process. I am going
to scratch the surface of these topics as well. If you are familiar with
Quality Assurance in software development industry or being agile/doing Scrum,
you will find here something for you as well!

### Why should you follow it?

You can find here topics mostly not related to specific programming language,
but common patterns that emerges of most of them. Feel free to use it in your
work! It may not be a secret knowledge mostly, but it might push your career
forward as well. 

Last but not least: you can observe progress in reaching the goal. Help me make
my work useful for million people!
